## Original Inspiration

The original idea has been taken from the nifty Scrinter tool. Read more about it here - http://www.osmosys.asia/Products.aspx?goto=0

## Known Issues

1. Clicking on the restore icon once is not enough, you'll have to click it twice when screen-cap is set to start in minimize mode, and minimize to tray is set.
